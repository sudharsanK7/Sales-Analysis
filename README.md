# Electronic Sales Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on electronic sales data. The project utilizes Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to analyze electronic sales data to derive insights and answer business-related questions. The dataset comprises monthly sales data for electronic products.

## Project Structure

- 'Sales_Data/': Directory containing the raw data files for each month.
- 'Sales Analysis.ipynb': Jupyeter notebook containing the sales analysis code.
- 'year_data.csv': Contains the concatenated data from all the month.
- **README.md**: Markdown file providing an overview of the project (you're reading it now).

## Data Preprocessing

- Combined monthly data into a single dataset for ease of analysis.
- Cleaned the data by removing unnecessary rows and columns.
- Added new columns for better analysis and visualization.

## Data Exploration

Explored various aspects of the dataset including:
- Monthly sales trends.
- Product-wise sales distribution.
- Relationship between sales and other variables (e.g., price, quantity).

## Business Questions

Answered several business questions by creating plots and charts:
1. What was the best month of sale, and how much?
2. Which city sold the most?
3. What is the best time to display ads to maximize reachability?
4. What were the products that sold the most together?
5. Products that sold the most and why?

## Dependencies
